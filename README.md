# Credit Card Approval Prediction

### By: Shrouk Abdelhameed Elmasry
#### Context
The goal of this project is to build a model to predict whether a customer's credit is good or bad based on their application data.
But the challenge is that the label good/bad in the data were not pre-defined. Instead, only credit history of past customers were given.

#### Task
Build a machine learning model to predict if an applicant is 'good' or 'bad' client, different from other tasks, the definition of 'good' or 'bad' is not given. You should use some techique, such as vintage analysis to construct you label. Also, unbalance data problem is a big problem in this task.


#### This end-to-end project is divided into 3 parts:

1. Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) & Feature Engineering
2. Feature Scaling and Selection (Imbalanced Data Handling)
3. Machine Learning Modelling (Classification)
