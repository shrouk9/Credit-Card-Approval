# Credit Card Approval Prediction

### By: Shrouk Abdelhameed Elmasry
## Context

Credit score cards are a common risk control method in the financial industry. It uses personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings. The bank is able to decide whether to issue a credit card to the applicant. Credit scores can objectively quantify the magnitude of risk. Generally speaking, credit score cards are based on historical data. Once encountering large economic fluctuations. 
 

It's a Kaggle competetion: https://www.kaggle.com/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction

## Task
The goal of this project is to build a model to predict whether a customer's credit is good or bad based on their application data.
But the challenge is that the label good/bad in the data were not pre-defined. Instead, only credit history of past customers were given.

## This end-to-end project is divided into 3 parts:

1. Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) & Feature Engineering
2. Feature Scaling and Selection (Imbalanced Data Handling)
3. Machine Learning Modelling (Classification)
